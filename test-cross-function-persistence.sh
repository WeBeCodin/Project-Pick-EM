echo "🔧 Testing Cross-Function Persistent Storage"
echo "============================================"

BASE_URL="https://project-pick-b2ng9bd4v-webecodins-projects.vercel.app"

echo ""
echo "✅ PERSISTENT STORAGE DEPLOYED"
echo "🔗 New URL: $BASE_URL"

echo ""
echo "🧪 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:"
echo "- Each API route (/api/leagues, /api/picks) runs on separate serverless functions"
echo "- When someone joins a league, it triggers /api/leagues on a new function instance"
echo "- This new instance doesn't share memory with the /api/picks function"
echo "- Result: Data stored in memory gets lost across function boundaries"

echo ""
echo "🛠️ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "- File-based persistent storage in /tmp/nfl-pickem-data/"
echo "- Both leagues.json and picks.json are shared across all functions"
echo "- All create/update operations now save to files immediately"
echo "- All read operations load from files on first access"

echo ""
echo "🔬 TECHNICAL DETAILS:"
echo "- SharedStorage class handles file I/O operations"
echo "- Data persists across different serverless function instances"
echo "- Automatic file initialization if not exists"
echo "- Immediate persistence after every data change"

echo ""
echo "🎯 CRITICAL TEST SCENARIOS:"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "1. LEAGUE JOIN PERSISTENCE TEST:"
echo "   □ Create a league on $BASE_URL"
echo "   □ Make some picks on Dashboard"
echo "   □ Have someone join your league (this triggers /api/leagues)"
echo "   □ ✅ Check that picks are still there"
echo "   □ ✅ Check that league is still there"
echo ""
echo "2. CROSS-FUNCTION DATA INTEGRITY:"
echo "   □ Create league → Make picks → Join league → Check both persist"
echo "   □ This tests data sharing between /api/leagues and /api/picks"
echo ""
echo "3. SERVERLESS FUNCTION RESET SIMULATION:"
echo "   □ Create data → Trigger multiple API calls → Verify persistence"
echo "   □ Each API call may spawn new function instances"

echo ""
echo "🔍 WHAT TO WATCH FOR:"
echo "- No more random resets when someone joins leagues"
echo "- Picks persist even when league operations happen"
echo "- Data remains consistent across all API operations"
echo "- Counter updates work regardless of function instance"

echo ""
echo "💡 TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENT:"
echo "This fix addresses the fundamental serverless architecture challenge"
echo "where stateless functions can't share in-memory data. The file-based"
echo "approach ensures data persistence across all function instances."

echo ""
echo "🎉 EXPECTED RESULT:"
echo "No more mysterious resets! Data should persist reliably even when"
echo "multiple users interact with leagues and picks simultaneously."
