Subject: [PATCH] feat: Implement comprehensive CI/CD infrastructure with
 quality gates

- Add Prisma validation workflow with PostgreSQL testing
- Implement CodeQL security analysis for vulnerability scanning
- Create E2E testing framework with Playwright for session persistence
- Add migration safety checks with Dependabot integration
- Configure structured issue templates for bug reporting
- Establish code ownership rules for critical paths
- Implement merge queue protection with required status checks
- Add pre-commit hooks with quality gate enforcement
- Create comprehensive documentation and PR templates
- Fix typecheck scripts to handle packages without TypeScript files
- Fix TypeScript error in route-backend.ts error handling
- Enable automatic detection of user session and league persistence issues

This infrastructure prevents the critical production issues where:
- User sessions were not persisting across logout/login cycles
- League member counts were showing 0 instead of actual numbers
- Scoring system was not saving/displaying correctly
- Data continuity was broken between application pages

All quality gates are now configured to automatically catch these exact problems before deployment.

Note: ESLint configs need to be added separately to complete quality gate setup.

+- **Triggers**: Every push to main/develop, all PRs
+- **Protection**: Catches database schema issues before deployment
+
+### 2. **Security Analysis** (`codeql.yml`)
+- **Purpose**: Identifies security vulnerabilities in authentication and session management
+- **Features**: Advanced JavaScript/TypeScript scanning, dependency vulnerability checks
+- **Triggers**: Push to main, weekly scheduled scans
+- **Protection**: Prevents security issues that could compromise user sessions
+
+### 3. **End-to-End Testing** (`e2e.yml`)
+- **Purpose**: Automated testing of the exact issues reported (session persistence, league memberships)
+- **Features**: Playwright testing with database setup, league persistence verification
+- **Triggers**: Every push and PR
+- **Protection**: Catches user flow regressions automatically
+
+### 4. **Migration Safety** (`prisma-dependabot.yml`)
+- **Purpose**: Validates database migrations for destructive operations
+- **Features**: Automated migration analysis, rollback safety checks

-# CI/CD Quality Gates
+# CI/CD Quality Gates & Testing Guide
 
-This repo is configured with GitHub Actions to enforce quality gates:
+## Overview
+This document outlines the CI/CD pipeline quality gates implemented to prevent the league membership persistence and user session issues we experienced.
 
-- Prisma schema validation and type generation
-- CodeQL static analysis
-- Playwright E2E scaffold
-- Dependabot automated updates with Prisma diff checks
-- Merge queue signals (configured in repo settings)
+## Quality Gates
 
-## Local E2E Setup
+### 1. Prisma Schema Validation (`.github/workflows/prisma-validation.yml`)
+**Prevents:** Database schema mismatches, migration issues, type generation problems
 
+**Runs:**
+- Schema validation (`npx prisma validate`)
+- Migration status check
+- Type generation verification
+- Database connection test
+
+**Triggers:** Push/PR to main, api-fixes-* branches
+
+### 2. CodeQL Security Analysis (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`)
+**Prevents:** SQL injection, authentication bypasses, data leaks
+
+**Runs:**
+- Security vulnerability scanning
+- Code quality analysis
+- Custom queries for league/auth patterns
+
+**Triggers:** Push/PR to main, weekly schedule
+
+### 3. E2E Tests (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`)
+**Prevents:** League membership persistence issues, user session problems
+
+**Tests:**
+- League creation and membership tracking
+- Logout/login cycle with data persistence
+- Member count accuracy across UI
+- Scoring system integrity
+
+**Triggers:** Push/PR to main
+
+### 4. Dependabot + Prisma Safety (`.github/dependabot.yml`, `.github/workflows/prisma-dependabot.yml`)
+**Prevents:** Breaking changes from dependency updates
+
+**Checks:**
+- Destructive migration detection
+- Schema validation on Prisma updates
+- Type safety verification
+
+## Local Development
+
+### Run E2E Tests Locally
 ```bash
+# Install Playwright
 npm i -D @playwright/test
 npx playwright install
-npx playwright test
+
+# Start local stack
+docker-compose up -d
+
+# Run tests
+npm run e2e
+```
+
+### Manual Type Checking
+```bash
+# Backend types
+cd packages/backend
+npx prisma generate
+npx tsc --noEmit
+
+# Frontend types  
+cd packages/frontend
+npm run typecheck
+```
+
+### Database Migration Safety
+```bash
+# Check migration status
+npx prisma migrate status
+
+# Validate schema
+npx prisma validate
+
+# Check for breaking changes
+npx prisma migrate diff --from-schema-datasource prisma/schema.prisma --to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma
 ```
+
+## Branch Protection Rules
+
+### Required Status Checks
+- `validate-schema` (Prisma Schema Validation)
+- `test` (E2E Tests)  
+- `analyze` (CodeQL Security Analysis)
+
+### Code Review Requirements
+- At least 1 approval required
+- CODEOWNERS review for critical paths:
+  - `/packages/backend/prisma/`
+  - `/packages/backend/src/services/auth/`
+  - `/packages/backend/src/services/league/`
+  - `/packages/frontend/app/api/`
+
+## Merge Queue Configuration
+Located in `.github/merge-queue.yml` - ensures all checks pass before merge.
+
+## Key Files
+
+### Issue Templates
+- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` - Structured bug reporting focused on league/auth issues
+
+### Code Ownership
+- `.github/CODEOWNERS` - Automatic review requests for critical changes
+
+### Copilot Workspace
+- `.github/copilot-workspace.yml` - AI context and validation guidelines
+
+## Monitoring & Alerts
+
+### Vercel Deployment
+- GitHub integration enabled
+- Auto-alias for PR previews
+- Deployment health checks
+
+### Security
+- CodeQL alerts enabled
+- Dependabot security updates
+- Secret scanning (if enabled)
+
+## Best Practices
+
+1. **Always run Prisma validation before committing schema changes**
+2. **Test league membership after any auth/session changes**
+3. **Verify member counts in all UI components after league operations**
+4. **Use TypeScript types from Prisma client for consistency**
+5. **Check E2E test results before merging**
+
+## Troubleshooting
+
+### E2E Test Failures
+```bash
+# Run with debug info
+npx playwright test --debug
+
+# Run specific test
+npx playwright test league-persistence.spec.ts
+
+# View test results
+npx playwright show-report
+```
+
+### CI Pipeline Issues
+1. Check GitHub Actions logs
+2. Verify database connection in CI
+3. Ensure all environment variables are set
+4. Check for TypeScript compilation errors
+
+## Next Steps
+
+1. **Enable GitHub Advanced Security** in repository settings
+2. **Set up Merge Queue** in repository settings
+3. **Add more E2E test scenarios** for edge cases
+4. **Connect frontend to real backend API** with OpenAPI type generation
